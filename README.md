This repository contains a collection of my solutions to programming problems from https://codeforces.com. I have not stopped my practice yet so I am going to keep adding new ones.

All the solutions are grouped by problem identifiers in order to facilitate the search.

I used C++ whenever possible and submitted with 32-bit GNU C++ 17 compiler.
